It is perhaps a bit late but I am starting to have quite a few posts on the topic of memory allocators and navigation was beginning to be a bit complex.

I thought it would be a good idea to have a central place that links everything together.

All the relevant code for this lives under [Gin]({% post_url 2015-05-03-introducing_gin %}) ([code](https://github.com/nfrechette/gin)) on GitHub.
