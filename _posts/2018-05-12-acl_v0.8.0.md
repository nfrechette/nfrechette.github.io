title: "Animation Compression Library: Release 0.8.0"
---
Today marks the **v0.8** [release](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl/releases/tag/v0.8.0) of the *Animation Compression Library*. It contains lots of goodies but by far the most significant point is the fact that it has now reached feature parity with *Unreal 4*. For the first time *Unreal 4* games should be able to run exclusively with *ACL*. The focus for the next 2 months will be to validate this with my custom *UE 4.15* integration and implement whatever might be missing as well as to create a proper and free plugin to bring *ACL* to the marketplace.

While I have already published some [decompression performance numbers]({% post_url 2018-05-11-acl_decompression_baseline %}) earlier this week, once a proper integration has been made, new numbers will be published to showcase how *ACL* performs against *Unreal 4* within the game engine itself. The existing numbers for the [Carnegie-Mellon University](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl/blob/develop/docs/cmu_performance.md) database, [Paragon](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl/blob/develop/docs/paragon_performance.md), and the [Matinee fight scene](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl/blob/develop/docs/fight_scene_performance.md) already clearly show *ACL* to be ahead in terms of compression time, compression ratio, and accuracy. However, while it remains to be seen if it will also be ahead with its decompression performance, I fully expect that it will.
