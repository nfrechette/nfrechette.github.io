title: "ACL 2.0 is hot off the press"
---
After 18 months of work, the [Animation Compression Library](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl) has finally reached [v2.0](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl/releases/tag/v2.0.0) along with an updated [v2.0 Unreal Engine 4 plugin](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl-ue4-plugin/releases/tag/v2.0.1).

Notable changes in this release include:

*  Unified and cleaned up APIs
*  Cleaned up naming convention to match C++ stdlib, boost
*  [Introduced streaming database support]({% post_url 2021-01-17-progressive_animation_streaming %})
*  Decompression profiling now uses [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark)
*  Decompression has been heavily optimized
*  Compression has been heavily optimized
*  First release to support backwards compatibility going forward
*  Migrated all math to [Realtime Math](https://github.com/nfrechette/rtm)
*  Clips now support 4 billion samples/tracks
*  [WebAssembly support added through emscripten](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl-js)
*  Many other improvements

Overall, this release is cleaner, leaner, and much faster.

[Decompression is now **1.4x** (PC) to **1.8x** (Mobile) faster than ACL 1.3](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl-ue4-plugin/blob/release/2.0/Docs/decompression_performance.md) which is no small feat! I'll be writing a blog post in the next few months with the juicy details. To make this possible, the memory footprint may increase slightly (mostly header related changes, a few bytes here and there, and alignment padding) but many datasets showed no increase at all. Quality remains unchanged.

# What's next

I've already started fleshing out the task list for the next minor release [here](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl/milestone/11). This release will bring about more memory footprint improvements.

If you use ACL and would like to help prioritize the work I do, feel free to reach out and provide feedback or requests!

ACL 2.0 turned out to be a massive undertaking and it took countless hours, late nights, and weekends to make it happen (over 1700 commits since the project began 4 years ago). As such, I'll pause development for a month or two (or three) while I focus on writing a few blog posts I've been meaning to get to and take a much needed break. However, I'll continue to make patch releases during this time if anything important pops up.

Special thanks to [NCSOFT](https://kr.ncsoft.com) for sponsoring many of the improvements that came with this major release!
