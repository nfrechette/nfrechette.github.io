title: Introducing the 'gin' library
---
`gin` aims to be a playground for high performance C++ ideas all under the MIT license. `gin` is currently empty but it will not remain so for long!

Here is an overview of the things I intend to cover in the coming posts and that will be included in the library:

A convenient memory allocator interface suitable for high performance and containers
Several high performance memory allocators (linear, frame, small block, heap, external, etc.)
A number of containers using the above technology (all sorts of array variants, bit sets, etc.)
And much more!

I will use C++11 features where relevant and keep things in headers as much as I can for easy integration as well as [all the popular reasons](http://bitsquid.blogspot.ca/2012/11/bitsquid-foundation-library.html).

I choose the name `gin` for a number of reasons: it is a refreshing drink for the upcoming summer months, there is no associated programming material with that word, it is short, and if I ever need a side project, I can cleverly name it `tonic`.

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/nfrechette/gin) on github.
